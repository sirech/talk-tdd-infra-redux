> Many development teams have adopted *test-driven development* practices for writing application code because of their benefits. 

--

<hr />
> Others have turned to *containers* to package and deploy their software, and it's accepted practice to use automated scripts to build the containers.

--

<hr />
> What weâ€™ve seen few teams do so far is combine the two trends and drive the writing of the container scripts using tests.

### Init

```ruby
require 'serverspec'
require 'docker'
require 'rspec/wait'

set :backend, :docker
set :docker_image, 'example-openjdk'

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.wait_timeout = 60 # seconds
end
```

---

### OS Version

```ruby
describe file('/etc/alpine-release') do
  its(:content) { is_expected.to match(/3.8.2/) }
end
```

---

### OS Version

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.8
```

---

### Java Version

```ruby
describe command('java -version') do
  its(:stderr) { is_expected.to match(/1.8.0_181/) }
end
```

---

### Java Version

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine3.8
```

---

### JAR

```ruby
describe file('gs-rest-service.jar') do
  it { is_expected.to be_file }
end
```

---

### JAR

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine3.8

WORKDIR /app
ENV VERSION="0.1.0"

COPY build/libs/gs-rest-service-${VERSION}.jar .
```

---

### App is running

```ruby
describe process('java') do
  it { is_expected.to be_running }
  its(:args) { is_expected.to contain('gs-rest-service.jar') }
end
```

---

### App is running

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine3.8

WORKDIR /app
ENV VERSION="0.1.0"

COPY build/libs/gs-rest-service-${VERSION}.jar gs-rest-service.jar

CMD ["java", "-jar", "gs-rest-service.jar"]
```

---

### Bound to right port

```ruby
describe 'listens to correct port' do
  it { wait_for(port(8080)).to be_listening.with('tcp') }
end
```

---

### Bound to right port

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine3.8

WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8080
ENV VERSION="0.1.0"

COPY build/libs/gs-rest-service-${VERSION}.jar gs-rest-service.jar

CMD ["java", "-jar", "gs-rest-service.jar"]
```

---

### Not running under root

```ruby
describe process('java') do
  its(:user) { is_expected.to eq('runner') }
end
```

---

### Not running under root

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine3.8

WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8080
ENV VERSION="0.1.0"

COPY build/libs/gs-rest-service-${VERSION}.jar gs-rest-service.jar

RUN adduser -D runner

USER runner
CMD ["java", "-jar", "gs-rest-service.jar"]
```
