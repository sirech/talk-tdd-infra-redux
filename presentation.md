> Many development teams have adopted *test-driven development* practices for writing application code because of their benefits. 

--

<hr />
> Others have turned to *containers* to package and deploy their software, and it's accepted practice to use automated scripts to build the containers.

--

<hr />
> What weâ€™ve seen few teams do so far is combine the two trends and drive the writing of the container scripts using tests.

- spring boot application with one route (/greeting), JAR already built

---

### Init

```ruby
require 'serverspec'
require 'docker'
require 'rspec/wait'

set :backend, :docker
set :docker_image, 'example-openjdk'

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.wait_timeout = 60 # seconds
end
```

---

### OS Version

```ruby
describe file('/etc/alpine-release') do
  its(:content) { is_expected.to match(/3.8.2/) }
end
```

---

### OS Version

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.8
```

---

### Java Version

```ruby
describe command('java -version') do
  its(:stderr) { is_expected.to match(/1.8.0_181/) }
end
```

---

### Java Version

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine3.8
```

---

### JAR

```ruby
describe file('gs-rest-service.jar') do
  it { is_expected.to be_file }
end
```

---

### JAR

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine3.8

WORKDIR /app
ENV VERSION="0.1.0"

COPY build/libs/gs-rest-service-${VERSION}.jar .
```

---

### App is running

```ruby
describe process('java') do
  it { is_expected.to be_running }
  its(:args) { is_expected.to contain('gs-rest-service.jar') }
end
```

---

### App is running

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine3.8

WORKDIR /app
ENV VERSION="0.1.0"

COPY build/libs/gs-rest-service-${VERSION}.jar gs-rest-service.jar

CMD ["java", "-jar", "gs-rest-service.jar"]
```

---

### Bound to right port

```ruby
describe 'listens to correct port' do
  it { wait_for(port(8080)).to be_listening.with('tcp') }
end
```

---

### Bound to right port

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine3.8

WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8080
ENV VERSION="0.1.0"

COPY build/libs/gs-rest-service-${VERSION}.jar gs-rest-service.jar

CMD ["java", "-jar", "gs-rest-service.jar"]
```

---

### Not running under root

```ruby
describe process('java') do
  its(:user) { is_expected.to eq('runner') }
end
```

---

### Not running under root

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine3.8

WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8080
ENV VERSION="0.1.0"

COPY build/libs/gs-rest-service-${VERSION}.jar gs-rest-service.jar

RUN adduser -D runner

USER runner
CMD ["java", "-jar", "gs-rest-service.jar"]
```

# Did the tests pass?

--

## Hell yes!

## Cool, let's run them on every commit now

## Access secret

```ruby

  it { wait_for(secret).to match(/the_secret/) }
end

  command('curl localhost:3000/secret').stdout
end
```

## Access secret

```javascript

    res.send(`The super secret value is ${process.env.SECRET}`))

## Injected at runtime

```ruby
describe file('/usr/sbin/entrypoint.sh') do
  it { is_expected.to be_file }
end
```

---

## Injected at runtime


```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

secret=$(
  aws --region "${AWS_REGION}" \
  secretsmanager get-secret-value \
  --secret-id "${SECRET_KEY}" \
  | jq -r .SecretString)
export SECRET="$secret"

exec "$@"
```

---

## Injected at runtime

```Dockerfile
FROM node:11.6-alpine

# ... install awscli
# ... node dependencies
# ... copy app

COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/sbin/entrypoint.sh

RUN adduser -D runner

USER runner
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-c"]

## Dependency setup

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  localstack:
    container_name: localstack
    image: localstack/localstack

    ports:
      - "4584:4584"

    environment:
      - DEFAULT_REGION=eu-central-1
      - SERVICES=secretsmanager
      
  ...
```

---

## Dependency setup

```yaml
  app:
    container_name: app
    build: ./app

    ports:
      - "3000:3000"

    env_file: .env

    links:
      - localstack
```

---

## Dependency setup

```ruby
require 'docker/compose'
set :docker_container, 'app'

RSpec.configure do |config|
  compose = Docker::Compose.new

  config.before(:all) { compose.up(detached: true, build: true) }

  config.after(:all) do
    compose.kill
    compose.rm(force: true)
  end
end
```

---

## That's a lot of *TDD*

```console
  Container File "/usr/sbin/entrypoint.sh" should be file
    1.28 seconds ./spec/container_spec.rb:29
  Container fetches a secret from ASM should match /localstack_secret/
    0.13081 seconds ./spec/container_spec.rb:33

2 examples, 0 failures
```

# Are you convinced now?

# Summary

## High quality containers are an important part of delivering software
## A quick feedback cycle is possible with meaningful tests

--

## This can be accomplished doing TDD
